This new frontier merges creativity with machine learning, offering fresh perspectives on artistic expression. In this blog post, I’ll share my experiences, the tools I experimented with, and the thoughts that arose during this exploration.\r\n\r\n<Toc />\r\n\r\n## What is AI Art?\r\n\r\nAI art refers to artwork created with the assistance of artificial intelligence. This can range from fully autonomous generative pieces to collaborative efforts where the artist guides the AI. With advancements in neural networks and deep learning, machines can now analyze vast datasets of existing art, enabling them to produce original works that challenge traditional notions of creativity.\r\n\r\n## My First Encounter: DALL-E 2\r\n\r\nMy journey began with OpenAI’s DALL-E 2, a tool that generates images from text prompts. Intrigued, I started by inputting whimsical ideas—“a sur"},{"slug":"generated-by-ai","title":"My First Hackathon Experience: Building a React Native App in 48 Hours","excerpt":"Join me as I recount my thrilling journey through my first university hackathon, where I built a React Native app and learned valuable lessons about teamwork and rapid development.","tags":["hackathon","react-native","mobile-development","university-life"],"categories":["Coding Adventures","Student Experiences"],"content":"\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nLast weekend, I participated in my first-ever university hackathon. It was an exhilarating 48-hour journey filled with coding, learning, and lots of coffee. In this blog post, I'll share my experience, the challenges we faced, and the lessons I learned along the way.\r\n\r\n## The Challenge\r\n\r\nOur team of four was tasked with creating a mobile app that could help solve a local community problem. We chose to build a React Native app that connects local food banks with donors and volunteers. The app, which we named \"FoodLink\", aimed to streamline the process of food donation and volunteer coordination.\r\n\r\n<Toc />\r\n\r\n## Day 1: Planning and Setup\r\n\r\n### Brainstorming and Wireframing\r\n\r\nWe kicked off the hackathon with a brainstorming session. Using a digital whiteboard, we sketched out our ideas and created rough wireframes for the app. Here's a simplified version of our initial app structure:\r\n\r\n```mermaid\r\ngraph TD\r\n  A[\"Home Screen\"] --> B[\"Donor Interface\"]\r\n  A --> C["},{"slug":"zen-browser","title":"Zen Browser Announces Move to Chromium: A New Era of Web Browsing","excerpt":"Zen Browser is making a significant shift to Chromium, promising enhanced performance, broader compatibility, and cutting-edge features.
